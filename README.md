- 👋 Hi, I’m Prince @eoprince
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to become a seasoned software developer. I plan to specialize on full stack and Blockchain related software so I can help build cool stuff in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in a fundational code immersion boot camp to help me start with the basics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project and with anyone who will be willing to help me learn and to improve on my skill as a developer.
- 📫 How to reach me... email me at ekele_prince@yahoo.com or contact me through twitter at @DonMckeson.
